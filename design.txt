General Idea:

1. Provide a specific player a notification when they have inspiration
2. Make it easier for players to remember that they have inspiration
3. Make an intuitive way to use inspiration within foundry
    Maybe if they have inspiration, whenever they make a qualifying roll,
    the advantage button will light up
4. Implement a voting system in roll20 for inspiration?


When a player has inspiration, a gold ampersand will show up next to
their player name. Whenever they make a roll, there will be a gold
ampersand button (?) next to the advantage. If they click that, it uses
their inspiration and gives them advantage.


For character in player.ownedCharacterList, if character.inspiration = true...
OR for character in characterList, if character.owned = currentPlayer, AND char.inspiration = true...
Then display inspiration marker on top right of screen, and next to player name.
Also, add inspiration button to rolls above/next to advantage button.
If inspiration button is clicked, remove inspiration from selected token. If no selected token,
remove inspiration from the first character controlled by the player.

Useful log for reference:
console.log(canvas.tokens.controlled[0].actor.data.data.attributes.inspiration);

If token.permissionOwned = current user

if: gold ampersand is not rendered:
for id in game.actors.ownership: 
    if id.get(game.users.current.id) = 3: // check if user has top level perms
    then, if:
        actor.attributes.inspiration = 1
        render a gold ampersand in the top right corner of player's screen


for (var i = 0; i < actorlist.length; i++) {console.log(actorlist[i].name)}

Fill a list of actors owned by current user, known as 
userOwnedActors

for (var i = 0; i < actorlist.length; i++) {
    for (id in actorlist[i].ownership) {
        if (id === game.users.current.id && id.getOwnership === 3 && actorlist[i].attributes.inspiration) {
            console.log(true)
            }
            
        }
}

for (var i = 0; i < actorlist.length; i++) {
    for (id in actorlist[i].ownership) {
        if (id === game.users.current.id && actorlist[i].system.attributes.inspiration) {
            display the icon
        }
            
    }
}
