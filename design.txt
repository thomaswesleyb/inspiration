General Idea:

1. Provide a specific player a notification when they have inspiration
2. Make it easier for players to remember that they have inspiration
3. Make an intuitive way to use inspiration within foundry
    Maybe if they have inspiration, whenever they make a qualifying roll,
    the advantage button will light up
4. Implement a voting system in roll20 for inspiration


When a player has inspiration, a gold ampersand will show up next to
their player name. Whenever they make a roll, there will be a gold
ampersand button (?) next to the advantage. If they click that, it uses
their inspiration and gives them advantage.
